This tutorial is meant to accompany a talk given by Matteo Niccoli and myself (Thomas Speidel) at the **2018 geoconvention** in Calgary, Canada titled [Data science tools for petroleum exploration and production](https://www.geoconvention.com/uploads/2018abstracts/290_GC2018_Data_science_tools_for_petroleum_e_and_p.pdf). Many of the ideas were inspired by Nicooli's past work. See for instance, [Machine learning in geoscience with scikit-learn - notebook 1](https://github.com/mycarta/predict/blob/master/Geoscience_ML_notebook_1.ipynb). 

This tutorial was created using the [open-source language R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#CRAN). However, most of the methods illustrated can be done in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). See Niccoli's implementation of some of these methods in the Python environment. See for instance the implementation of [distance correlation](https://github.com/mycarta/Niccoli_Speidel_2018_Geoconvention/blob/master/Python_heatmap_and_distance_correlation.ipynb)in Python.
